## Diagnostic

In case of problems, you can enable the debug mode to get more information about the issue,
by passing the `--debug` flag to the Vagrant command.

```shell
vagrant up --debug
```

The messages generated by the plugin are pretty verbose and should help you to understand what is going wrong.

If you can't solve the issue, please open a new issue on [https://github.com/letiemble/vagrant-tart/issues](https://github.com/letiemble/vagrant-tart/issues).
